## üöÄ About

This project is a **Logging API** service built with **Python**, acting as a wrapper around Apache Kafka to provide scalable and modular log processing through pluggable appenders such as **PostgreSQL** and **Amazon S3**.

### Main Features

* Receive and process structured log data via a REST API built with **FastAPI**
* Publish logs asynchronously to **Apache Kafka** for reliable message queuing
* Route and store logs through modular **appenders** (currently PostgreSQL and Amazon S3)
* Ensure fault-tolerant, scalable, and decoupled logging pipelines
* Easily extendable with additional appenders or processing backends

### Technologies Used

* **Backend:** FastAPI with Apache Kafka for asynchronous message streaming
* **Database Appender:** PostgreSQL implemented with **SQLAlchemy** ORM
* **Cloud Storage Appender:** AWS S3 integration via **Boto3**
* **Containerization:** All components (API, Appenders, Nginx) are packaged using Docker and managed by **Kubernetes** under **Minikube**.
* **Architecture:** Modular appender system allowing simple integration of new storage or processing backends

This setup provides a fast, modular, and scalable logging infrastructure, combining **FastAPI‚Äôs performance** and **Kafka‚Äôs reliability** to ensure seamless data flow from ingestion to persistent storage across **PostgreSQL** and **S3** backends.
